# 🚀 Codebase Optimization Plan

**Branch:** `feature/codebase-optimization`
**Target:** 50% code reduction, 40% performance improvement, 90% complexity reduction

## 📊 Current State Analysis

### Metrics (Baseline)

- **Files:** 295 TypeScript files (~55K lines in features)
- **Hooks:** 57 feature hooks (22 in members alone)
- **Dependencies:** 840MB node_modules
- **Issues:** Over-engineering, client-side operations, duplication, mock data

### Critical Problems Identified

1. **Hook Explosion** - 57 hooks when 15-20 would suffice
2. **Client-side sorting/filtering** - Should be database-level
3. **N+1 queries** - Inefficient database operations
4. **Code duplication** - CSV utils, filters repeated across features
5. **Premature optimizations** - Realtime presence, orchestration
6. **Bundle bloat** - Heavy dependencies, no code splitting

---

## 🎯 Phase-by-Phase Implementation

### **Phase 1: Hook Consolidation**

**Goal:** Reduce hooks by 70% (57 → 15-20)

**🚨 CRITICAL:** After each consolidation, immediately perform cleanup:

1. **Update all imports** in components using deleted hooks
2. **Replace with consolidated equivalents** that provide same functionality
3. **Test build** to ensure no broken imports remain
4. **Maintain user functionality** - no features should be lost

#### Members (22 → 6 hooks)

- [ ] **Keep:** `use-members.ts`, `use-member-search.ts`, `use-member-filters.ts`
- [ ] **Merge into use-members.ts:**
  - [ ] `use-member-count.ts`
  - [ ] `use-bulk-operations.ts`
  - [ ] `use-export-members.ts`
- [ ] **Delete (over-engineered):**
  - [ ] `use-realtime-members.ts` (606 lines - presence tracking)
  - [ ] `use-composed-queries.ts` (593 lines - mock orchestration)
  - [ ] `use-advanced-search.ts` (merge into search)
  - [ ] `use-background-sync.ts` (unnecessary complexity)
  - [ ] `use-route-cache-manager.ts` (premature optimization)
  - [ ] `use-member-notifications.ts` (can be simplified)
  - [ ] 16 other specialized hooks

#### Trainers (9 → 3 hooks)

- [ ] **Keep:** `use-trainers.ts`, `use-trainer-search.ts`
- [ ] **Merge:** All count/export/analytics into main hooks
- [ ] **Delete:** Over-specialized hooks

#### Training Sessions (11 → 4 hooks)

- [ ] **Keep:** Core CRUD, search, calendar, booking
- [ ] **Delete:** Specialized validation/credit hooks

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] Hook count: 57 → 15-20 (-70%)
- [ ] Bundle size reduction: ~200KB
- [ ] Maintainable hook structure

---

### **Phase 2: Database Optimization**

**Goal:** Move operations to PostgreSQL, add proper indexing

#### Server-Side Operations

- [ ] **Move sorting to database**
  - [ ] Remove client sorting in `AdvancedMemberTable.tsx:119-142`
  - [ ] Add ORDER BY clauses to all queries
- [ ] **Database aggregations**
  - [ ] Replace `getMemberCountByStatus()` client loop with SQL COUNT
  - [ ] Add PostgreSQL functions for complex analytics
  - [ ] Use database GROUP BY instead of client reduce()

#### Query Optimization

- [ ] **Add database indexes**
  - [ ] `CREATE INDEX idx_members_name ON members(first_name, last_name)`
  - [ ] `CREATE INDEX idx_members_status ON members(status)`
  - [ ] `CREATE INDEX idx_members_search ON members USING gin(to_tsvector('english', first_name || ' ' || last_name))`
- [ ] **Fix N+1 queries**
  - [ ] Batch specialization lookups in `convertSpecializationUuidsToNames`
  - [ ] Single transaction for `deleteTrainer` cascade
- [ ] **Cursor-based pagination**
  - [ ] Replace OFFSET with cursor pagination for large datasets

#### Database Functions

- [ ] **Create PostgreSQL functions**
  ```sql
  CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_member_stats()
  RETURNS JSON AS $$
  SELECT json_build_object(
    'total', COUNT(*),
    'active', COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'active'),
    'inactive', COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'inactive')
  ) FROM members;
  $$ LANGUAGE SQL;
  ```

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] All sorting/filtering server-side
- [ ] Query time < 100ms for 10K records
- [ ] Database CPU usage reduction by 60%
