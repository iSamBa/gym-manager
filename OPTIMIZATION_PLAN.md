# ðŸš€ Codebase Optimization Plan

**Branch:** `feature/codebase-optimization`
**Target:** 50% code reduction, 40% performance improvement, 90% complexity reduction

## ðŸ“Š Current State Analysis

### Metrics (Baseline)

- **Files:** 295 TypeScript files (~55K lines in features)
- **Hooks:** 57 feature hooks (22 in members alone)
- **Dependencies:** 840MB node_modules
- **Issues:** Over-engineering, client-side operations, duplication, mock data

### Critical Problems Identified

1. **Hook Explosion** - 57 hooks when 15-20 would suffice
2. **Client-side sorting/filtering** - Should be database-level
3. **N+1 queries** - Inefficient database operations
4. **Code duplication** - CSV utils, filters repeated across features
5. **Premature optimizations** - Realtime presence, orchestration
6. **Bundle bloat** - Heavy dependencies, no code splitting

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase-by-Phase Implementation

### **Phase 1: Hook Consolidation**

**Goal:** Reduce hooks by 70% (57 â†’ 15-20)

#### Members (22 â†’ 6 hooks)

- [ ] **Keep:** `use-members.ts`, `use-member-search.ts`, `use-member-filters.ts`
- [ ] **Merge into use-members.ts:**
  - [ ] `use-member-count.ts`
  - [ ] `use-bulk-operations.ts`
  - [ ] `use-export-members.ts`
- [ ] **Delete (over-engineered):**
  - [ ] `use-realtime-members.ts` (606 lines - presence tracking)
  - [ ] `use-composed-queries.ts` (593 lines - mock orchestration)
  - [ ] `use-advanced-search.ts` (merge into search)
  - [ ] `use-background-sync.ts` (unnecessary complexity)
  - [ ] `use-route-cache-manager.ts` (premature optimization)
  - [ ] `use-member-notifications.ts` (can be simplified)
  - [ ] 16 other specialized hooks

#### Trainers (9 â†’ 3 hooks)

- [ ] **Keep:** `use-trainers.ts`, `use-trainer-search.ts`
- [ ] **Merge:** All count/export/analytics into main hooks
- [ ] **Delete:** Over-specialized hooks

#### Training Sessions (11 â†’ 4 hooks)

- [ ] **Keep:** Core CRUD, search, calendar, booking
- [ ] **Delete:** Specialized validation/credit hooks

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] Hook count: 57 â†’ 15-20 (-70%)
- [ ] Bundle size reduction: ~200KB
- [ ] Maintainable hook structure

---

### **Phase 2: Database Optimization**

**Goal:** Move operations to PostgreSQL, add proper indexing

#### Server-Side Operations

- [ ] **Move sorting to database**
  - [ ] Remove client sorting in `AdvancedMemberTable.tsx:119-142`
  - [ ] Add ORDER BY clauses to all queries
- [ ] **Database aggregations**
  - [ ] Replace `getMemberCountByStatus()` client loop with SQL COUNT
  - [ ] Add PostgreSQL functions for complex analytics
  - [ ] Use database GROUP BY instead of client reduce()

#### Query Optimization

- [ ] **Add database indexes**
  - [ ] `CREATE INDEX idx_members_name ON members(first_name, last_name)`
  - [ ] `CREATE INDEX idx_members_status ON members(status)`
  - [ ] `CREATE INDEX idx_members_search ON members USING gin(to_tsvector('english', first_name || ' ' || last_name))`
- [ ] **Fix N+1 queries**
  - [ ] Batch specialization lookups in `convertSpecializationUuidsToNames`
  - [ ] Single transaction for `deleteTrainer` cascade
- [ ] **Cursor-based pagination**
  - [ ] Replace OFFSET with cursor pagination for large datasets

#### Database Functions

- [ ] **Create PostgreSQL functions**
  ```sql
  CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_member_stats()
  RETURNS JSON AS $$
  SELECT json_build_object(
    'total', COUNT(*),
    'active', COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'active'),
    'inactive', COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'inactive')
  ) FROM members;
  $$ LANGUAGE SQL;
  ```

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] All sorting/filtering server-side
- [ ] Query time < 100ms for 10K records
- [ ] Database CPU usage reduction by 60%

---

### **Phase 3: Eliminate Duplication**

**Goal:** DRY principle - centralize repeated code

#### Shared Utilities

- [ ] **Centralize CSV export**
  - [ ] Create `/src/lib/csv-utils.ts`
  - [ ] Delete `features/members/lib/csv-utils.ts`
  - [ ] Delete `features/trainers/lib/csv-utils.ts`
- [ ] **Unified search**
  - [ ] Create `/src/lib/search-utils.ts`
  - [ ] Generic search hook pattern
- [ ] **Shared filter primitives**
  - [ ] Create `/src/lib/filter-utils.ts`
  - [ ] Remove duplicated filter logic

#### Component Deduplication

- [ ] **Status badges**
  - [ ] Merge member/trainer status badges
  - [ ] Generic `<StatusBadge />` component
- [ ] **Avatar components**
  - [ ] Unify member/trainer avatars
- [ ] **Table actions**
  - [ ] Shared action buttons (edit/delete/view)

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] Code duplication < 5% (from ~20%)
- [ ] Single source of truth for utilities
- [ ] Reusable component library

---

### **Phase 4: Remove Premature Optimizations**

**Goal:** Delete unused complex code

#### Realtime Features (Likely Unused)

- [ ] **Audit usage of realtime**
  - [ ] Check if `useRealtimeMembers` actually used
  - [ ] Remove presence tracking (who's viewing/editing)
  - [ ] Delete conflict resolution logic
- [ ] **Delete files:**
  - [ ] `use-realtime-members.ts` (606 lines)
  - [ ] Presence components
  - [ ] WebSocket connection management

#### Orchestration Complexity

- [ ] **Remove orchestration hooks**
  - [ ] `useOrchestatedMemberQueries`
  - [ ] `useConditionalMemberQueries`
  - [ ] Complex loading states
- [ ] **Simplify cache strategies**
  - [ ] Remove route-based cache management
  - [ ] Keep only TanStack Query defaults

#### Mock Data & Hard-coding

- [ ] **Replace mock data**
  - [ ] Dashboard stats (app/page.tsx:47-76)
  - [ ] Analytics simulations
  - [ ] Connect to real database

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] Remove 1500+ lines of unused code
- [ ] Simplified architecture
- [ ] No WebSocket overhead unless needed

  - [ ] Lazy load heavy components
  - [ ] Route-based code splitting
- [ ] **Bundle analysis**
  - [ ] Add `npm run analyze` script
  - [ ] Identify largest chunks

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] Initial bundle < 500KB (from ~800KB)
- [ ] Route-level code splitting
- [ ] Faster first paint

### **Phase 6: Component Memoization**

**Goal:** Optimize React re-renders

#### React Performance

- [ ] **Memoization**
  - [ ] `React.memo` on table components
  - [ ] `useMemo` for sorted/filtered data
  - [ ] `useCallback` for event handlers
- [ ] **Virtual scrolling**
  - [ ] For large tables (1000+ rows)
  - [ ] Use `react-window` or similar
