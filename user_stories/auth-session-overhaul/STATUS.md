### US-002: Server-Side Auth Middleware

**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed
**Assigned**: Claude
**Started**: 2025-10-04
**Completed**: 2025-10-04

**Checklist**:

- [x] `@supabase/ssr` installed (v0.7.0)

- [x] Git commit created

**Notes**:

- Migrated client-side supabase.ts to use createBrowserClient from @supabase/ssr for cookie compatibility
- Fixed public route matching logic (exact match for "/" instead of startsWith)
- Removed conflicting redirect logic from login page
- Middleware successfully validates sessions server-side (72.1 kB)
- All security objectives achieved

### US-003: Complete Auth Event Handling

**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed
**Assigned**: Claude
**Started**: 2025-10-04

- [x] `PASSWORD_RECOVERY` event handled
- [x] `MFA_CHALLENGE_VERIFIED` event handled

- [x] Retry logic for network errors (exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s)
- [x] Auth error state in Zustand store
- [x] `auth-error-banner.tsx` created
- [x] Tests passing (838/838 tests)
- [x] Linting passing (0 errors, 0 warnings)

- All 7 events now handled (INITIAL_SESSION, SIGNED_IN, SIGNED_OUT, TOKEN_REFRESHED, USER_UPDATED, PASSWORD_RECOVERY, MFA_CHALLENGE_VERIFIED)
- Each event fires exactly once (fixed duplicate event issue)
- Error banner with retry/dismiss functionality implemented
- Removed debug console.logs for production

### US-004: Session Validation on Tab Focus

**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed
**Assigned**: Claude
**Started**: 2025-10-04
**Completed**: 2025-10-04

**Checklist**:

- [x] `use-session-security.ts` removed (did not exist)
- [x] `use-session-validator.ts` created

- [x] Session validation on tab focus
- [x] Expired session triggers logout
- [x] Throttling to prevent excessive API calls (30s window)
- [x] Tests passing (9/9 new tests, 847/847 total)
- [x] Linting passing (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- [x] Git commit created

**Notes**:

- Created comprehensive session validator hook with 9 unit tests
- Validates session when tab becomes visible (visibilitychange event)
- Throttles validation to max once per 30 seconds
- Auto-logout on expired sessions
- Graceful handling of network errors (doesn't logout)
- Integrated into AuthProvider
- All acceptance criteria met

### US-005: Secure State Persistence

**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed
**Assigned**: Claude
**Started**: 2025-10-04
**Completed**: 2025-10-04

**Checklist**:

- [x] Decision made: Option A (no persist) - chosen for security and simplicity
- [x] Zustand `persist` middleware removed from useAuthStore
- [x] Session restoration via `supabase.auth.getSession()` tested (INITIAL_SESSION event)
- [x] "Remember me" feature removed (no code references found)
- [x] Page refresh maintains session (via Supabase httpOnly cookies)
- [x] Expired sessions cleared properly (handled by middleware + tab focus validation)
- [x] Tests passing (847/847 tests)
- [x] Linting passing (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- [x] Git commit created

**Notes**:

- Removed Zustand persist middleware - auth state now in-memory only
- Added JSDoc to useAuthStore explaining security rationale
- Implemented one-time cleanup of legacy localStorage keys (auth-storage, remember-me, last-activity)
- Session management entirely handled by Supabase via httpOnly cookies
- No auth data stored in plaintext localStorage (XSS protection)
- Tradeoff: ~100-300ms initial load time for DB query (acceptable for security)
- All security objectives achieved
