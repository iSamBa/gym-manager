## 🔍 Pattern Analysis

**Remaining Patterns** (Out of Scope - Expected):

1. ✅ `.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0)` in date-utils.ts
   - **Status**: CORRECT (inside getStartOfDay() function - proper abstraction)

2. 🟡 `.toISOString().split("T")[0]` in 8 locations
   - **Status**: OUT OF SCOPE for US-001 through US-005
   - **Files**: Trainers feature, member forms, database storage formatting, analytics
   - **Note**: Completed user stories focused on utils, validation, and training sessions
   - **Future Work**: These can be migrated in future user stories

**Patterns Eliminated in Scope**:

- ✅ All member/subscription utils migrated
- ✅ All frontend validation migrated
- ✅ All training-sessions migrated
- ✅ 0 problematic patterns in completed features
