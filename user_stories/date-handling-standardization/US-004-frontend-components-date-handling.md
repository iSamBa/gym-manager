# US-004: Frontend Components Date Handling

**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Priority**: P1 (User-Facing)
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours
**Actual Time**: 45 minutes
**Dependencies**: US-001
**Completed**: 2025-10-18

## 📋 User Story

**As a** gym administrator
**I want** all date pickers and comparisons to work correctly in my timezone
**So that** dates display and behave as expected in the UI

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: OpeningHoursTab Uses compareDates

**File**: `src/features/settings/components/OpeningHoursTab.tsx` (lines 145-160)

**Already partially fixed, complete the migration**:

```typescript
// Current uses string comparison (good!)
// Migrate to use compareDates() for consistency
import { compareDates } from "@/lib/date-utils";
const shouldShowPreview = compareDates(effectiveFromStr, new Date()) > 0;
```

### AC2: EffectiveDatePicker Uses Local Date

**File**: `src/features/settings/components/EffectiveDatePicker.tsx` (line 27-28)

Replace:

```typescript
const today = new Date();
today.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
```

With:

```typescript
import { getLocalDateString } from "@/lib/date-utils";
// For date comparison in disabled prop
```

### AC3: All Date Comparisons Migrated

Search for patterns:

- `.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0)`
- `.getTime()` comparisons

Replace with `compareDates()`.

## ✅ Definition of Done

- [x] All frontend components use date-utils
- [x] No `.setHours(0,0,0,0)` patterns
- [x] Date pickers work correctly
- [x] Tests passing

## 📝 Implementation Notes

**Files Modified**:

1. `src/lib/date-utils.ts` - Added `getStartOfDay()` function for UI date comparisons
2. `src/lib/__tests__/date-utils.test.ts` - Added 5 comprehensive tests for `getStartOfDay()`
3. `src/features/training-sessions/components/forms/SessionBookingForm.tsx` - Migrated date picker validation
4. `src/features/members/components/CommentDialog.tsx` - Migrated due date validation (2 instances)

**What Was Completed**:

- ✅ Added new `getStartOfDay()` helper function to date-utils (returns Date object at midnight)
- ✅ Eliminated ALL `.setHours(0,0,0,0)` patterns from entire codebase (0 remaining)
- ✅ SessionBookingForm date picker now uses `getStartOfDay()` for past date validation
- ✅ CommentDialog due date validation now uses `getStartOfDay()` for past date prevention
- ✅ All `.getTime()` patterns reviewed - confirmed they're legitimate uses (timestamp comparisons, date arithmetic)
- ✅ 51/51 date-utils tests passing (including 5 new tests)
- ✅ All component tests passing (CommentDialog: 18/18)
- ✅ Manual testing completed via Puppeteer - validation working correctly

**What Was Skipped**:

- ⏭️ OpeningHoursTab, EffectiveDatePicker - These files don't exist on this branch
  - They're on `feature/studio-settings-opening-hours` branch (US-002 blocked)
  - Will be addressed when that branch merges to dev

**Testing Results**:

- Automated tests: ✅ 51/51 passing
- TypeScript: ✅ 0 errors (unrelated errors existed before)
- Linting: ✅ 0 errors, 0 warnings
- Build: ✅ Successful
- Manual testing (Puppeteer):
  - ✅ SessionBookingForm date picker works correctly
  - ✅ CommentDialog prevents saving comments with past due dates
  - ✅ Validation displays correctly to users
  - ✅ No console errors

**Time**: 45 minutes (under 1-2 hour estimate)
