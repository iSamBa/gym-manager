## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Decisions Made

- **US-001**: Documented 1 table without RLS (invoice_counters) - justified as technical utility table for triggers only

### Technical Debt

- None yet

### Learnings

- **US-001**: Helper functions (is_admin, is_trainer_or_admin) centralize role checks and simplify policy maintenance

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. ✅ **US-001 Completed** - Security hardening and RLS documentation
2. ✅ **US-002 Completed** - Database indexes and query optimization
3. ✅ **US-003 Completed** - Environment validation and input sanitization
4. ✅ **US-004 Completed** - Transaction Handling & Data Integrity
5. ⏳ **Start US-005** - Error Handling & User Experience (next P1 item)
