## 📝 Notes

### Implementation Decisions

**Circular Referral Prevention:**

- Will implement using recursive CTE in database query
- Front-end will also validate to provide immediate feedback

**Training Preference Field:**

- Nullable to allow members to skip during creation
- Only shown/editable for female members

**Uniform Size Editing:**

- Explicitly allow changes even after uniform_received = true
- Use case: Member needs different size after trying uniform
