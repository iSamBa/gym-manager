# US-008: Testing & Polish

**Epic:** Member Profile Enhancement - Equipment & Referral Tracking
**Story ID:** US-008
**Priority:** P0 (Must Have)
**Complexity:** Small (~45 minutes)
**Dependencies:** ✅ US-005, ✅ US-006, ✅ US-007
**Status:** 🟡 PENDING

---

## 📝 User Story

**As a** developer
**I want** comprehensive testing and final polish of the member details redesign
**So that** the feature is production-ready, bug-free, and performs optimally

---

## 💼 Business Value

**Why This Matters:**

- **Quality Assurance:** Catch bugs before production deployment
- **User Confidence:** Polished UI inspires trust and professionalism
- **Performance:** Ensure fast, smooth interactions for staff
- **Maintainability:** Well-tested code is easier to maintain and extend

**Impact:**

- Without this: Bugs in production, poor user experience, performance issues
- With this: Stable, fast, professional member profile view

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

### Visual Regression Testing

- [ ] **AC-001:** Test all field combinations:
  - Member with all fields populated (complete profile)
  - Member with minimal fields (name, email only)
  - Member without emergency contacts
  - Member without phone number
  - Member without address
  - Member without medical considerations
  - Member without referred_by (direct acquisition)
  - Member without subscription

- [ ] **AC-002:** Test gender-specific rendering:
  - Male member → Training Preferences card hidden
  - Female member with preference → Training Preferences card shown with badge
  - Female member without preference → Training Preferences card shown with "Not Specified"

- [ ] **AC-003:** Test equipment status variations:
  - Uniform received = true → Green badge "✓ Received"
  - Uniform received = false → Amber badge "⚠ Not Received"
  - All vest size variations render correctly (V1, V2, extensions)

- [ ] **AC-004:** Test alert combinations:
  - No alerts → "No alerts" empty state with green checkmark
  - Expiring subscription only → Single amber alert
  - Missing uniform only → Single amber alert
  - Upcoming birthday only → Single amber alert
  - Outstanding payments only → Single red alert
  - Multiple alerts → All shown in order (critical first, then warnings)

### Functional Testing

- [ ] **AC-005:** Quick action buttons work:
  - "Book Session" opens session booking (AddSessionButton dialog)
  - "Record Payment" opens payment recording (AddPaymentButton dialog)
  - "Edit Profile" opens EditMemberDialog with all fields
  - "Delete" opens ConfirmDialog for member deletion
  - All buttons show loading states when actions in progress

- [ ] **AC-006:** Click-to-copy functionality:
  - Email copy works, shows toast, shows checkmark
  - Phone copy works, shows toast, shows checkmark
  - Checkmark reverts to copy icon after 2 seconds
  - Copy works on all browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

- [ ] **AC-007:** Referral link navigation:
  - "View Member" link in ReferralDisplay navigates to referred member's profile
  - Link only shown when referred_by_member_id exists
  - Navigation maintains back/forward browser history

### Responsive Testing

- [ ] **AC-008:** Desktop layout (≥1024px):
  - Header: Avatar left, buttons right, single row
  - Main content: 2-column (main 2/3, sidebar 1/3)
  - Cards: 2-column grids within cards where applicable
  - All content readable, no overflow

- [ ] **AC-009:** Tablet layout (768px - 1023px):
  - Header: Avatar left, buttons wrap to second row
  - Main content: 2-column maintained
  - Cards: 2-column grids maintained
  - Touch targets at least 44x44px

- [ ] **AC-010:** Mobile layout (<768px):
  - Header: Stacks vertically (avatar + name, then buttons)
  - Main content: Single column stack (main, then sidebar)
  - Cards: 1-column grids
  - Emergency contacts: 1 per row
  - All text readable without zooming

### Performance Testing

- [ ] **AC-011:** React DevTools Profiler checks:
  - Member details page renders in <500ms (initial load)
  - Card components have <30% unnecessary re-renders
  - Changing member status doesn't re-render entire page
  - useMemberActivityMetrics doesn't cause render loops

- [ ] **AC-012:** Network performance:
  - Page makes <5 database queries on load
  - Activity metrics query returns in <200ms
  - No redundant data fetching
  - Proper query caching (React Query)

### Code Quality

- [ ] **AC-013:** TypeScript & Linting:
  - No TypeScript errors (`npm run build` succeeds)
  - No linting errors (`npm run lint` passes)
  - No `any` types in new code
  - All components properly typed

- [ ] **AC-014:** Component size compliance:
  - MemberProfileHeader: <200 lines
  - All card components: <150 lines each
  - Display components: <100 lines each
  - page.tsx: <400 lines

### Edge Cases

- [ ] **AC-015:** Data edge cases:
  - Member with 0 emergency contacts → Empty state shows
  - Member with >5 emergency contacts → Grid layout handles properly
  - Very long names → Text wraps or truncates appropriately
  - Very long addresses → Text wraps appropriately
  - Future end_date → No expiring subscription alert

- [ ] **AC-016:** Birthday edge cases:
  - Birthday today → Alert shows "0 days"
  - Birthday on leap day (Feb 29) → Handles correctly
  - Birthday already passed this year → No alert
  - Invalid date_of_birth → No error, graceful handling

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Step 1: Create Test Data Generator

**File:** `src/features/members/__tests__/test-data-generator.ts`

```typescript
import type { Member } from "@/features/database/lib/types";

export const generateTestMember = (overrides?: Partial<Member>): Member => {

    waiver_signed_date: "2024-01-15",
    created_by: null,
    member_type: "full",
    uniform_size: "M",
    uniform_received: true,
    vest_size: "V2",
    hip_belt_size: "V1",
    referral_source: "website_ib",
    referred_by_member_id: null,
    training_preference: null,
    emergency_contacts: [],
    subscription: null,
    ...overrides,
  };
};

// Test scenarios
export const testScenarios = {
  completeProfile: generateTestMember({
    emergency_contacts: [
      {
        first_name: "Jane",
        last_name: "Doe",
        relationship: "Spouse",
        phone: "+1-555-0101",

      },
    ],
    medical_considerations: "None",
  }),

  minimalProfile: generateTestMember({
    phone: null,
    address: null,
    date_of_birth: null,
    medical_considerations: null,
  }),

  femaleWithPreference: generateTestMember({
    gender: "female",
    training_preference: "mixed",
  }),

  missingUniform: generateTestMember({
    uniform_received: false,
  }),

  referred: generateTestMember({
    referral_source: "member_referral",
    referred_by_member_id: "ref-member-456",
  }),
