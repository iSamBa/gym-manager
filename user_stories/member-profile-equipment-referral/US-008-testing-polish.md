    uniform_size: "M",
    uniform_received: true,
    vest_size: "V2",
    hip_belt_size: "V1",
    referral_source: "website_ib",
    referred_by_member_id: null,
    training_preference: null,
    emergency_contacts: [],
    subscription: null,
    ...overrides,
  };
};

// Test scenarios
export const testScenarios = {
  completeProfile: generateTestMember({
    emergency_contacts: [
      {
        first_name: "Jane",
