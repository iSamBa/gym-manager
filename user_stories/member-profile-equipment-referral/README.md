## üéØ Business Value

### Problems Solved

1. **Manual Equipment Tracking**
   - **Before:** Staff manually track equipment sizes and distribution on paper/spreadsheets
   - **After:** Digital tracking integrated into member profiles with instant access

2. **Missing Referral Data**
   - **Before:** No visibility into how members discover the gym
   - **After:** Complete referral source tracking with member-to-member attribution

3. **Limited Training Preferences**
   - **Before:** Female members must manually communicate session preferences
   - **After:** Preferences stored in profile for better session planning

### Expected Outcomes

- **Operational Efficiency:** 50% reduction in time spent tracking equipment
- **Marketing Insights:** Data-driven understanding of acquisition channels
- **Member Experience:** Personalized training session recommendations
- **Inventory Planning:** Future-ready for equipment inventory analytics

## ‚ú® Features

### 1. Equipment Sizing & Tracking

**Uniform Size**

- Sizes: XS, S, M, L, XL
- Required field during member creation
- Editable at any time (even after distribution)

**Uniform Distribution Status**

- Boolean flag: Received / Not Received
- Tracks whether member picked up their uniform
- Default: Not Received

**Vest Size**

- Options: V1, V2, V2 with Small Extension, V2 with Large Extension, V2 with Double Extension
- Required field for all members

**Hip Belt Size**

- Options: V1, V2
- Required field for all members

### 2. Referral Source Tracking

**Acquisition Channels:**

1. Instagram
2. Member Referral
3. Website IB (Inbound)
4. Prospection (Outbound sales)
5. Studio (Walk-in)
6. Phone
7. Chatbot

**Member Referral Logic:**

- When "Member Referral" is selected ‚Üí Show member selector

  - Cannot refer themselves
  - Cannot create referral loops (A ‚Üí B ‚Üí A)

**Use Cases:**

- Marketing analysis: Identify highest-performing acquisition channels
- Referral programs: Track member-to-member referrals for incentives
- ROI calculation: Attribute members to marketing campaigns

---

### 3. Training Session Preferences

**Training Preference (Female Members Only):**

- Options: Mixed Sessions / Women Only Sessions
- Conditional field: Only appears/applies to female members
- Nullable: Not required (allows member to decide later)

**Use Cases:**

- Session planning: Schedule appropriate sessions based on preferences
- Member experience: Respect cultural/personal preferences
- Gym operations: Balance mixed and women-only class offerings

| `hip_belt_size`         | ENUM    | NO       | -       | V1, V2                                                                    |
| `referral_source`       | ENUM    | NO       | -       | 7 channels (see above)                                                    |
| `referred_by_member_id` | UUID    | YES      | NULL    | FK ‚Üí members.id, CHECK (id != referred_by_member_id)                      |
| `training_preference`   | ENUM    | YES      | NULL    | mixed, women_only, CHECK (gender='female' OR training_preference IS NULL) |

**ENUM Types:**

```sql
CREATE TYPE uniform_size_enum AS ENUM ('XS', 'S', 'M', 'L', 'XL');
CREATE TYPE vest_size_enum AS ENUM ('V1', 'V2', 'V2_SMALL_EXT', 'V2_LARGE_EXT', 'V2_DOUBLE_EXT');
CREATE TYPE hip_belt_size_enum AS ENUM ('V1', 'V2');
CREATE TYPE referral_source_enum AS ENUM ('instagram', 'member_referral', 'website_ib', 'prospection', 'studio', 'phone', 'chatbot');
CREATE TYPE training_preference_enum AS ENUM ('mixed', 'women_only');
```

**Constraints:**

- Self-referral prevention: `referred_by_member_id != id`
- Training preference constraint: Only female members can have training preference
- Foreign key: `referred_by_member_id` ‚Üí `members.id` ON DELETE SET NULL

**Circular Referral Prevention:**
Implemented via recursive CTE check or database trigger to prevent referral loops.

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

1. **Form Validation**
   - Test all field validations (required fields, enum values)
   - Test conditional field visibility (referred_by, training_preference)
   - Test circular referral prevention logic

2. **Display Formatting**
   - Test ENUM value formatting helpers
   - Test conditional section rendering

### Integration Tests

1. **Member Creation**
   - Create member with all equipment fields
   - Create member with member referral
   - Create female member with training preference
   - Verify circular referral prevention

2. **Member Details View**
   - Load member and verify all fields display correctly
   - Verify conditional sections render appropriately

3. **Member Edit**
   - Edit equipment fields
   - Change uniform size after received = true
   - Edit referral information
   - Test circular referral prevention on edit

### E2E Tests (Manual)

1. **Full Member Lifecycle**
   - Create ‚Üí View ‚Üí Edit ‚Üí Save
   - Test all field combinations
   - Verify database persistence
