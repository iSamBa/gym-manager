## 📊 Current vs. Target State

### Current State (Problems)

- "Load More" button for pagination (inefficient navigation)
- Join Date column cluttering table
- Redundant View action (duplicates row click)
- Edit/Delete in table (should be in details only)
- Double $ symbol bug
- Badge makes balance text too small
- Non-functional column filter
- Unnecessary tooltips

### Target State (Solution)

- shadcn/ui pagination with page navigation
- Clean table without Join Date
- Quick actions only: Add Session, Add Payment
- Balance with colored background, proper formatting
- Working or removed column filter
- No tooltips on sessions/balance columns

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **No database changes required** - only frontend modifications
- **Maintain current performance** - server-side pagination stays the same
- **Follow CLAUDE.md guidelines** - use React.memo, useCallback, shadcn/ui only
- **Test thoroughly** - ensure existing member flows still work
