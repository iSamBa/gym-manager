I want you to use the architect agent for this task.
The agent should create an architectural plan for the implementation of the following feature

# The feature

I want to enable the Admin and the Trainers to book training sessions for the members.

- A training session can either be a _trial_ training session, or a _standard_ training session (as a part of the subscription)

- For a training session, we need one trainer, and up to the maximum clients the trainer can have. this information is in the trainer profile.

- In addition to the trainer and the members, a session needs a studio (we will need to implement equipment management later not now), a date and a duration (default durations - 15 minutes for the trial, and 25 minutes for the standard)

- A training session should also have a comment/note section where the trainer or the admin can add session specific notes and comments.

- When a session is booked, it should appear in the member details view (think about having a tabs implementation because we will need to show more information in the future) and it should also appear in the trainer detail view

# The UI

- We need a new menu item in the sidebar for the training sessions
- The first thing we see when clicking the trainins sessions menu item, is a calendar with the complete date in a sort of calendar grid view, overview, and all the planned training sessions
- The session block should show the trainer, members, and location (start and end time if needed)
- I should be able to switch between Day, Week or Month view.
- Adding a training session should follow the same pattern as for the members and trainers.
- check the training availability, showing validation errors if the trainer is already booked or not available.

If you are missing any information, or something is not clear for you, ask me.
