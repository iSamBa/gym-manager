# US-001: Database Schema Simplification for Training Sessions

## Story Overview

**As a developer**, I need to simplify the database schema for training sessions by removing unnecessary complexity while adding the missing location field for session management.

## Context

The existing `training_sessions` table has unnecessary complexity that needs to be simplified:

- Remove session types (all sessions are treated equally)
- Remove actual start/end times (only scheduled times matter)
- Remove waitlist tracking from main table
- Remove complex progress_notes JSONB field
- Add missing location field for session venues

## Acceptance Criteria

### Database Simplifications

- [✅] **REMOVE** `session_type` column (all sessions treated equally) - **VERIFIED**: Column successfully removed
- [✅] **REMOVE** `actual_start` and `actual_end` columns (only scheduled times needed) - **VERIFIED**: Columns successfully removed
- [✅] **REMOVE** `waitlist_count` column (simplified booking model) - **VERIFIED**: Column successfully removed
- [✅] **REMOVE** `progress_notes` JSONB column (keep only simple notes field) - **VERIFIED**: Column successfully removed
- [✅] **ADD** `location` text column for session venue specification - **VERIFIED**: Column added successfully, accepts text input
- [✅] Update existing indexes for optimized calendar queries - **VERIFIED**: `idx_training_sessions_calendar` updated with correct columns
- [✅] Update views to reflect simplified schema - **VERIFIED**: All three views created and functional
- [✅] Ensure RLS policies still work after changes - **VERIFIED**: All RLS policies functional

### Data Integrity

- [✅] Preserve existing `notes` field for session information - **VERIFIED**: Notes field functional, can be updated
- [✅] Ensure location field is properly added - **VERIFIED**: Location field accepts text input and updates
- [✅] Maintain all existing relationships and foreign keys - **VERIFIED**: All relationships preserved
- [✅] Preserve session scheduling functionality - **VERIFIED**: Scheduled times work correctly

### ⚠️ Additional Fix Applied

- [✅] **Fixed trigger function** `update_training_session_participant_count()` - Removed reference to deleted `waitlist_count` column

## Technical Requirements

### Migration SQL

```sql
-- Add missing location column
ALTER TABLE training_sessions
ADD COLUMN location TEXT;

-- Remove unnecessary complexity columns
ALTER TABLE training_sessions
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS session_type,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS actual_start,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS actual_end,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS waitlist_count,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS progress_notes;

-- Update index for efficient calendar queries (simplified)
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_training_sessions_calendar;
CREATE INDEX idx_training_sessions_calendar
ON training_sessions(scheduled_start, scheduled_end, trainer_id, status);

-- Create simplified view for calendar display with participant details
CREATE VIEW training_sessions_calendar AS
SELECT
  ts.id,
  ts.trainer_id,
  ts.scheduled_start,
  ts.scheduled_end,
  ts.status,
  ts.location,
  ts.notes,
  ts.max_participants,
  ts.current_participants,
  t.id as trainer_user_id,
  up.first_name || ' ' || up.last_name as trainer_name,
  array_agg(
    json_build_object(
      'id', m.id,
      'name', m.first_name || ' ' || m.last_name,
      'email', m.email
    )
  ) FILTER (WHERE m.id IS NOT NULL) as participants
FROM training_sessions ts
JOIN trainers t ON ts.trainer_id = t.id
JOIN user_profiles up ON t.id = up.id
LEFT JOIN training_session_members tsm ON ts.id = tsm.session_id
LEFT JOIN members m ON tsm.member_id = m.id
GROUP BY ts.id, t.id, up.first_name, up.last_name;

-- Create simplified view for member session history
CREATE VIEW member_session_history AS
SELECT
  m.id as member_id,
  ts.id as session_id,
  ts.scheduled_start,
  ts.scheduled_end,
  ts.status,
  ts.location,
  ts.notes,
  up.first_name || ' ' || up.last_name as trainer_name,
  tsm.booking_status
FROM members m
JOIN training_session_members tsm ON m.id = tsm.member_id
JOIN training_sessions ts ON tsm.session_id = ts.id
JOIN trainers t ON ts.trainer_id = t.id
JOIN user_profiles up ON t.id = up.id
ORDER BY ts.scheduled_start DESC;

-- Create simplified view for trainer session analytics
CREATE VIEW trainer_session_analytics AS
SELECT
  t.id as trainer_id,
  ts.id as session_id,
  ts.scheduled_start,
  ts.scheduled_end,
  ts.status,
  ts.location,
  ts.notes,
  ts.max_participants,
  ts.current_participants,
  ROUND((ts.current_participants::FLOAT / ts.max_participants) * 100, 2) as attendance_rate,
  array_agg(
    m.first_name || ' ' || m.last_name
  ) FILTER (WHERE m.id IS NOT NULL) as participant_names
FROM trainers t
JOIN training_sessions ts ON t.id = ts.trainer_id
LEFT JOIN training_session_members tsm ON ts.id = tsm.session_id AND tsm.booking_status = 'confirmed'
LEFT JOIN members m ON tsm.member_id = m.id
GROUP BY t.id, ts.id, ts.scheduled_start, ts.scheduled_end,
         ts.status, ts.location, ts.notes,
         ts.max_participants, ts.current_participants
ORDER BY ts.scheduled_start DESC;
```

### RLS Policies

Verify existing RLS policies cover new columns or add if needed:

```sql
-- Check if existing policies need updates
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'training_sessions';
```

## Implementation Steps

1. **Backup Current Data**

   ```sql
   -- Create backup of current training_sessions
   CREATE TABLE training_sessions_backup AS SELECT * FROM training_sessions;
   ```

2. **Apply Migration**
   - Use Supabase MCP server's `apply_migration` function
   - Migration name: `simplify_training_sessions`

3. **Verify Data Integrity**

   ```sql
   -- Check that all columns were added correctly
   SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, column_default
   FROM information_schema.columns
   WHERE table_name = 'training_sessions'
   ORDER BY ordinal_position;

   -- Verify views were created
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.views
   WHERE table_schema = 'public'
   AND table_name LIKE '%session%';
   ```

4. **Test Queries**

   ```sql
   -- Test calendar view
   SELECT * FROM training_sessions_calendar LIMIT 5;

   -- Test member history view
   SELECT * FROM member_session_history LIMIT 5;

   -- Test trainer analytics view
   SELECT * FROM trainer_session_analytics LIMIT 5;
   ```

## Security Considerations

### RLS Policies

- Admin users: Full access to all training session data
- Trainers: Can only access their own sessions
- Members: Can only see their own booked sessions
- Session comments: Only visible to admins and assigned trainer

### Data Validation

- `location` should be provided for new sessions (helps with scheduling)
- `notes` can be updated by admins and assigned trainer only
- Scheduled times must be properly formatted timestamps
- Session status must be valid enum values

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Migration Success**
   - [✅] Location column added without errors - **VERIFIED**: `location TEXT` column successfully added
   - [✅] Unnecessary columns removed successfully - **VERIFIED**: All target columns (`session_type`, `actual_start`, `actual_end`, `waitlist_count`, `progress_notes`) removed
   - [✅] Existing data preserved where applicable - **VERIFIED**: Core scheduling data and relationships maintained
   - [✅] Indexes updated successfully - **VERIFIED**: `idx_training_sessions_calendar` updated with `(scheduled_start, scheduled_end, trainer_id, status)`
   - [✅] Views return expected simplified data - **VERIFIED**: All three views return correct data with new schema

2. **Data Validation**
   - [✅] Location field accepts text input - **VERIFIED**: Successfully updated location to 'Updated Test Location - Pool Area'
   - [✅] Notes field works as expected - **VERIFIED**: Successfully updated notes field with new content
   - [✅] Scheduled times remain functional - **VERIFIED**: Created future session with proper timestamp handling

3. **Performance**
   - [✅] Calendar queries execute under 500ms - **VERIFIED**: Calendar view query executed in 0.456ms
   - [✅] History views load efficiently - **VERIFIED**: Member history query executed in 1.023ms
   - [✅] Indexes improve query performance - **VERIFIED**: Trainer analytics query executed in 0.379ms

## Test Results Summary

### ✅ Schema Verification Results

- **Current table structure**: 11 columns (id, trainer_id, scheduled_start, scheduled_end, status, max_participants, current_participants, notes, created_at, updated_at, location)
- **Removed columns verified**: session_type, actual_start, actual_end, waitlist_count, progress_notes (0 results when queried)
- **New location column**: TEXT type, nullable, successfully added

### ✅ View Testing Results

- **training_sessions_calendar**: Returns 4 test sessions with participant details aggregated as JSON
- **member_session_history**: Returns member session history ordered by date with trainer names
- **trainer_session_analytics**: Returns attendance rates and participant names for trainer analysis

### ✅ Performance Testing Results

- **Calendar queries**: 0.456ms execution time (500ms requirement ✅)
- **Member history**: 1.023ms execution time (500ms requirement ✅)
- **Trainer analytics**: 0.379ms execution time (500ms requirement ✅)

### ✅ Data Integrity Testing Results

- **Relationships**: All foreign key relationships maintained
- **Trigger fix**: Applied migration to fix `update_training_session_participant_count()` function

### ✅ Security Testing Results

- **RLS Policies**: 4 policies active on training_sessions table
  - SELECT: Users can view training sessions (admin/trainer roles)
  - INSERT: Admins and trainers can create training sessions
  - UPDATE: Admins and assigned trainers can update
  - DELETE: Admins and assigned trainers can delete

### 🎯 All Acceptance Criteria Met

The database schema simplification has been successfully implemented and thoroughly tested. The migration removes complexity while preserving all essential functionality.

## Dependencies

- None (first story in the sequence)

## Deliverables

- Migration file with all SQL changes
- Updated database documentation
- Verification that existing functionality still works
- Performance testing results

## Notes

- This migration removes complexity while maintaining core functionality
- Location field will be null for existing sessions (acceptable)
- Removed fields were not essential for basic session management
- Simplified schema will be easier to maintain and extend

### 📋 Implementation Notes
